Frogs,"Each frog has an entry in the book. Initially you only see the name, and the 'hint' - which is giving the player a clue of what traits they should try and get to make that species. Species names are usually just something based on the trait representation they have. Once discovered the frog will show the 2 lore sentances (which a paragraph break inbetween), as well as the 'likes'. 'likes' are a list of 3 things each frog has - they're mostly just for fun and are using the frogs main trait extremes to come up with funny little things that frog would 'like'. They dont have any lore implications. The 'b_name/c_name' are variants, these are frogs that are slightly modified versions of the original species that are not different enough to become a different species, i.e. a common green (4444444) with slightly more amplitude (5444444) becomes a common 'b' variant (greater green). These are shown in the book as icons to discover along with a hint of what to do to get that variant. the variant name is shown in the tooltip of variant frogs too. The 'key' is a 2char combination rendered on any slot with a frog inside to help identify between frogs without just color/pattern/shape. This has to be latin characters as custom font, so for JP/CN maybe just copy the english ones",,,

Critters,Critters are the bugs you find across the game that you can eat and feed to tadpoles to grow big and strong. Each critter has a book entry that only shows the name and the 'hint' entry to give players a clue. Some NPCs also give critter clues in their dialogue. Hovering over a critter or the item will show the item 'tooltip' entry. Once discovered the book will show the 2 lore sentances seperated by a paragraph. The 'action' key is used in part of the description in the later ui_book_critter_x label keys.,,,Ribbit

Quests,"The game has a bunch of quests, half are 'learning' quests that teach you something, and half are 'story' quests that guide you towards the end goal. Each quest has a title (darker lines), and is made up of smaller single-page 'chapters' that also have their own name (lighter lines). the <sp_item> words are merge fields, and will be turned into an icon. They should not be translated, just placed where you want the icon to appear. They shouldn't have punctuation attached to them directly if possible. Each chapter has up to 3 lines + an 'action' at the end - you can use all 3 lines or just one, however DO NOT use line breaks. Split your lines over the 3 keys for the chapter where you want the paragraph breaks. The tone is light, informative, some puns now and then, I've tried to keep it more like 'you do this, you need to do this, NPC gave you this' rather than 'we' but honestly just pick a style you like and keep it consistent throughout all quests. Most quest / chapter names are either idioms, puns, or sayings in english so i appreciate most wont work at all, so go for whatever you'd like (with the exception of 'A'N'O'U'R'E'S' which should match your acronym for the traits in that order)",,,Ribbit

quest101t,,,Sidequested,Ribbit
quest1011,,,Ribbert <sp_npc2_item> has told you that the path to the seal is via several lifts that are out of service.,Ribbit
quest1012,,,However to get to the spare parts needed you'll need to first clear the algae that's overgrown in the region - good thing you're not shy of hard work!,Ribbit
quest1013,,,,Ribbit
quest102t,,,No Filter,Ribbit
quest1021,,,Ribbert's filters <sp_filter_item> will allow you to use high edacity frogs to clear the blooms.,Ribbit
quest1022,,,Place the filter somewhere on the algae to begin - you can see the area the filter will effect when hovering over it.,Ribbit
quest1023,,,"Add frogs with a 7 edacity trait to start the process, more frogs means faster removal!",Ribbit
quest102a,,,Use a filter,Ribbit
quest103t,,,Special Delivery,Ribbit
quest1031,,,Ribbert <sp_npc2_item> mentioned that there is a secondary dock just north of them that has some supplies still on the pier.,Ribbit
quest1032,,,"There should be a lift bucket <sp_liftkey_item> in those supplies somewhere, hopfully.",Ribbit
quest1033,,,You'll need to clear the algae bloom around the feeders nearby first before you can reach the dock.,Ribbit
quest103a,,,Install spare bucket,Ribbit
quest104t,,,Not The Sharpest Tool,Ribbit
quest1041,,,With the lift bucket <sp_liftkey_item> you can now use the central lift <sp_lift_item> to access more of the region.,Ribbit
quest1042,,,"Ribbert <sp_npc2_item> mentioned a maintenance shed to the south that should have a lift bucket, but you'll need to clear another feeder area first to get to it - shocker I know.",Ribbit
quest1043,,,,Ribbit
quest104a,,,Install backup bucket,Ribbit
quest105t,,,Busy Bees,Ribbit

quest109t,,,Catching Spores,Ribbit
quest1091,,,"Now that Ribbert has the research, they can make the equipment needed and guide you on the process.",Ribbit
quest1092,,,First you need a spore net <sp_net2_item> which you can then use to harvest spores.,Ribbit
quest1093,tweaked wording to be clearer (might not need this in your local version),,You can harvest spores from natural spawns or from your cultivators when spores are present (before they bloom).,Ribbit
quest109a,,,Get some spores,Ribbit
quest1010t,,,The Small Print,Ribbit
quest10101,,,"Now you have some spores, you can use the spore printer <sp_printer_item> to make prints of the mushrooms.",Ribbit

quest10103,,,The two spores you combine will lead to a mushroom with the modifications of both species.,Ribbit
quest1010a,,,Make a hybrid print,Ribbit
quest1011t,,,That New Mushroom Smell,Ribbit
quest10111,,,"With your spore paper, you'll need to get spore cultivators <sp_scultivator_item> to grow them.",Ribbit
quest10112,,,"These work like normal cultivators, but allow you to put in spore paper to add spores.",Ribbit
quest10113,,,"You'll still need to wait for the right conditions though, but that can match any of the two species you combined, how versatile!",Ribbit
quest1011a,,,Harvest a hybrid mushroom,Ribbit

quest1153,,,,Ribbit
quest1012t,,,Infinite Possibilities,Ribbit
quest10121,,,You can combine any two mushrooms together to get a single mushroom with both effects.,Ribbit

quest1211,,,Kroaka <sp_npc3_item> thinks that the seal you're after is up past the construction site.,Ribbit
quest1212,,,But to get past them you'll first need to reactivate 3 pumps in the district to drain the quarries.,Ribbit
quest1213,,,You'll also need to drain some of the houses on the way in order to access them.,Ribbit
quest122t,,,Home And Dry,Ribbit
quest1221,,,Kroaka <sp_npc3_item> got their grubby mitts on 2 machines that will let you modify the moisture levels.,Ribbit

npc1_1_1,intro,,Hey! How're you feeling? The name's Hopert!,Ribbit
npc1_1_2,,,"I brought you here once you respawned. Pulling you out the mud took it out of me, I'm not quite the froglet I used to be!",Ribbit
npc1_1_3,,,"The Pondmother told me you'd be coming, said you'll be able to help us out in restoring this place?",Ribbit

npc1_1_6,,,"Anything else you need let me know, otherwise I'll let you hop to it!",Ribbit
npc1_2,what doin,,What are you doing here?,Ribbit
npc1_2_1,,,I'm part of the team sent to this research pond after we didn't hear back for a while. Seems to have been a pretty bad winter that took you all off guard.,Ribbit
npc1_2_2,,,"Originally we were here on a salvage mission until your Pondmother reached out in our dreams, she'd managed to get a lot of frogs into torpor but it took a lot out of her.",Ribbit
npc1_2_3,,,"Respawning you probably took all her remaining energy, but she can rest easy now you're here to get things back on track.",Ribbit
npc1_3,who,,Who else is in the team?,Ribbit
npc1_3_1,,,"There's myself, a mycologist, a historian and an engineer. I set up down here in the spawning pools in the previous carpenter's shack, saved bringing all my tools!",Ribbit
npc1_3_2,,,"The mycologist went to the kindergarten in the west, it's been overgrown with some sort of algae that they're trying to remove. ",Ribbit
npc1_3_3,,,The historian headed up to the central junction to get a headstart on preparations for bringing the Pondmother back through.,Ribbit
npc1_3_4,,,The engineer went to the habitats to the east. There's been some flooding to the area and we want to repair it before we respawn everyone else.,Ribbit
npc1_3_5,,,Now that you're here as our geneticist that makes it 5! We could be the Frog Force 5! No? That's fair enough.,Ribbit
npc1_4,sidequest,,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc1_4_1,,,"Actually there is! That ladder over there leads to a loft, seems like there's some stuff stored up there.",Ribbit
npc1_4_2,,,"However it needs a key and I didn't manage to find it as I was clearing the place out, if you come across it could you bring it to me?",Ribbit
npc1_4_3,,,Also if you come across any blueprints bring them here and I'll be able to make them for you!,Ribbit
npc1_4b_1,,,"Now that you found that loft key I'll be all set for a while, thanks again for bringing it to me!",Ribbit

npc1_6,bugs,,Eaten any nice bugs recently?,Ribbit
npc1_6_1,,,"Now that you mention it, there's some very salty dracoflies around here! Far nicer than the stuff we have down south, but you have to brave the rain to find them.",Ribbit
npc1_6_2,,,"I also saw some butterflies the other day when things cleared up, but they looked far too sweet for my tastes, I'm more a savoury frog!",Ribbit
npc1_7,blueprints,,I found a blueprint!,Ribbit
npc1_7_1,blueprint breeder,,Excellent work! These blueprints are still in great condition. Seems to be for a machine to create large amounts of tadpoles and frogspawn for a species?,Ribbit
npc1_7_2,,,I'll add it to my inventory for the next time we trade!,Ribbit
npc1_8,blueprints,,I found a blueprint!,Ribbit

npc1_10,blueprints,,I found a blueprint!,Ribbit
npc1_10_1,blueprint projector,,Nice job! They're a bit tattered but I can make out most of it. Looks like it's for a workstation to plan out hybrid mushrooms effects.,Ribbit

npc1_11,blueprints,,I found a blueprint!,Ribbit
npc1_11_1,blueprint bug trap,,Good work! Seems like it's for a machine to trap bugs automatically - takes a bit of the fun out of catching them no?,Ribbit
npc1_11_2,blueprint line 2,,I'll add it to my inventory for the next time we trade!,Ribbit
npc1_12,blueprints,,I found a blueprint!,Ribbit

npc1_13,sidequest done,,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc1_13_1,,,I think that finally I have no more jobs for you! What a relief eh?,Ribbit

npc2_1_1,intro,,"Oh! Mudborne! Sorry, I didn't see you there! Please excuse the mess.",Ribbit
npc2_1_2,,,"Welcome to the Kindergarten, the region responsible for all the food needs for the pond, as well as for raising frogs and mycelia research.",Ribbit
npc2_1_3,,,Unfortunately the rich nutrients kept in the water for the tadpoles has led to some large algae blooms that have grown unchecked this whole time.,Ribbit
npc2_1_4,,,"Dendro said you're looking for a seal? I have to admit I've not heard of it, but I am still in training so, I have a lot to learn!",Ribbit
npc2_1_5,,,"There are some older relics up north, I haven't been able to get up there myself yet but that might be what you're looking for.",Ribbit
npc2_1_6,,,"You can get there via the service lifts, however a couple of them have been taken down for maintenance so you'll need to get some spare lift buckets to use them.",Ribbit
npc2_1_7,,,The temporary dock above us should have a spare bucket - I imagine you'd find some in the maintenance shed and up by the apiary too.,Ribbit
npc2_1_8,give quest10,,"Start with dock first, I'll trade you for some filters that you can use to clear the algae!",Ribbit
npc2_2,"question1, what doing",,What's your job here?,Ribbit
npc2_2_1,,,As the mycologist of the team I was originally responsible for gathering any unique specimens from this pond as well as recovering the research done here.,Ribbit
npc2_2_2,,,"With you here that'll still be my job, but with the added bonus of helping you bring this place back to life!",Ribbit
npc2_2_3,,,"Pond 7 was always at the cutting edge of all research fields, so I'm very grateful for the opportunity to learn more about the botany they've been doing here.",Ribbit
npc2_2_4,,,"I wasn't the first choice for the recovery team, the original mycologist had to drop out, but I promise I won't let you down!",Ribbit
npc2_2_5,,,When you're not knee-deep in algae I'd love for you to help me with recovering some of that research! ,Ribbit
npc2_3,"question2, hybrid",,You mentioned recovering research?,Ribbit
npc2_3_1,,,"Ah yes, if you have the time I'd very much appreciate it!",Ribbit
npc2_3_2,,,"There's a lot of research that was being done here, but in particular I'm curious to see these hybrid mushrooms I've heard about, they sound fascinating.",Ribbit
npc2_3_3,,A,"According to the map, there's a laboratory out west that was focusing on hybridising spores - combining two different mushrooms together into one species.",Ribbit
npc2_3_4,give quest11,,If you can find the laboratory and bring me back the research I might be able to recover the processes for you to use yourself.,Ribbit
npc2_4,I found the hybrid research!,,I found the hybrid mushroom research!,Ribbit
npc2_4_1,,,"Oh excellent work {{NAME}}, this is just what I was looking for.",Ribbit
npc2_4_2,,,"Now I have this I'll be able to look into making the equipment they were using to create hybrid mushrooms, which will let you make your own.",Ribbit

npc2_5,"question3, can i help",,Anything else I can help with?,Ribbit
npc2_5_1,,,"Well, I don't want to add even more to your already overflowing plate but, if it's not too much to ask I do have one more thing!",Ribbit
npc2_5_2,,,When I was first exploring I saw a bunch of small stagnant water pools - intentionally created by the looks of it. ,Ribbit
npc2_5_3,,,"I'm curious to know what they were doing with them, to my knowledge pretty much most creatures can't stand stagnant water.",Ribbit
npc2_5_4,,,"If you find any information or research on these pools, please let me know!",Ribbit
npc2_6,I found the stagnant pool research!,,I found some notes on the stagnant pools!,Ribbit
npc2_6_1,,,"Oh you did? That's wonderful news, thank you so much! Let's have a look at it...",Ribbit
npc2_6_2,,,"Ah this is very interesting, seems like they found a couple of different species of mushrooms that have adapted to the stagnant waters.",Ribbit
npc2_6_3,,,It also looks like they found a way to localise the stagnation using high odour frogs - I think I should be able to replicate the machine they were using to let you make your own stagnant pools!,Ribbit
npc2_6_4,,,The next time you want to trade for equipment I'll add them to my inventory!,Ribbit
npc2_7,"question3, can i help, done",,Anything else I can help with?,Ribbit

npc2_8,question4 any bugs,,Eaten any nice bugs recently?,Ribbit
npc2_8_1,,,"There's some great pickings around here! I definitely recommend the crickets that sing from the shrubs at night - very salty and moreish, tough to catch though.",Ribbit
npc2_8_2,,,"I've heard that the bees up by the apiary are good if you like spicy bugs, but best not let the keepers catch you eating them when they're out of hibernation or there'll be hell to pay.",Ribbit
npc2_9,"question2, hybrid done",,Any more missing research?,Ribbit
npc2_9_1,,,"I think that covers all the research I was told about, thanks so much again for helping me find it.",Ribbit
npc2_9_2,,,It's been so wonderful to learn about all the stuff they were working on here. Maybe one day after I finish my training I can put in a transfer request...,Ribbit

npc4_1_5,,,"Saying that, I'm not quite sure what to do... I've never been in a situation where everything has shut down like this, what did the team say?",Ribbit
npc4_1_6,,,The old seals... really? I've heard Dumeril talk about them but I can't say I know how they work.,Ribbit
npc4_1_7,,,I know where it is but... the path has thawed out since the control center went haywire.,Ribbit
npc4_1_8,,,We'll need to get that back up and running first before you can get what you're after.,Ribbit
npc4_2,"question 1, what happened?",,What happened here?,Ribbit
npc4_2_1,,,"I'm sure you know about the winter storm that got us all into this mess by now, it definitely was the worst I've ever seen.",Ribbit
npc4_2_2,,,Rahna was struggling to get everyone respawned... I brought some of the staff up here to use the hibernator machines we store here.,Ribbit
npc4_2_3,,,As I started to head back down to the junction I saw a huge blue flash. The cold hit like a shockwave.,Ribbit
npc4_2_4,,,It was like nothing I've ever felt before. I barely had enough time to get myself into this machine.,Ribbit
npc4_2_5,,,We didn't get any new dreamers after that...,Ribbit
npc4_3,"question 2, can I help?",,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc4_3_1,,,I think I'm okay... I'll need to take some time to get back up to speed with everything.,Ribbit
npc4_3_2,,,"Although actually, thinking about it there's is some special gear in the inventory here that the caretakers use that might help you.",Ribbit
npc4_3_3,,,It's still locked down but if you can find any spare caretaker keycards I can unlock the items for you.,Ribbit
npc4_4,"question 3, how to get to the seal?",,How do I reach the seal?,Ribbit
npc4_4_1,,,So I'm afraid you've got a few hoops to hop through here...,Ribbit
npc4_4_2,,,"The control core usually regulates the temperatures up here, keeping our labs warm and the storage warehouses cold.",Ribbit
npc4_4_3,,,"It also connects to three main cooling domes, which keep some of the waters nearby frozen to give us more space to utilise.",Ribbit
npc4_4_4,,,With the system offline these waters have melted... it'll be impossible to get to one of the areas where the sealmaker should be.,Ribbit
npc4_4_5,,,Our portable cooler machines work great for shallower waters but they can't create ice on the deeper spots.,Ribbit
npc4_4_6,,,"Once you reboot the system you'll be able to get across to the area where the sealmaker should be, just follow the pipes up to the north-east.",Ribbit
npc4_4_7,,,"The area up there is pretty old though, you might have better luck traversing through the dream.",Ribbit
npc4_5,"question 4, bugs",,Any good bugs to eat here?,Ribbit
npc4_5_1,,,"There's some lovely blue beetles that come out of the mud during the day, bit of an acquired taste for some but I personally love them.",Ribbit
npc4_5_2,,,"There are also some really tasty butterflies that like the vines that grow on the buildings, but they only come out under the cover of snowfall.",Ribbit
npc4_6,,,I've found a keycard!,Ribbit
npc4_6_1,,,Ah wonderful news! Let's see... this one unlocks our hibernator storage.,Ribbit
npc4_6_2,,,They'll let you sleep until specific times or conditions... just set what you want to wait for and take a little nap.,Ribbit
npc4_6_3,,,I'll add them to my inventory next time we trade.,Ribbit
npc4_7,,,I've found a keycard!,Ribbit
npc4_7_1,,,Oh great work! Let me see... this one unlocks our alchemist storage.,Ribbit
npc4_7_2,,,"Alchemists are wonderful tools, they're like a cauldron except they can store unlimited powders inside them.",Ribbit
npc4_7_3,,,You can then pick from any of the powders to make your mud as normal.,Ribbit
npc4_7_4,,,I'll add them to my inventory next time we trade.,Ribbit
npc4_8,,,I've found a keycard!,Ribbit
npc4_8_1,,,"Ah excellent work! Let me have a look... ah, this one unlocks our multicrate storage.",Ribbit
npc4_8_2,,,"While similar to normal crates, these have seperate tabs, making it easier to organise all of your stuff.",Ribbit
npc4_8_3,,,I'll add them to my inventory next time we trade.,Ribbit
npc4_9,,,Dumeril sent me!,Ribbit
npc4_9_1,,,"He... wait... what!? I... Oh thank goodness! I didn't know if he was alive or not. I never saw him in the dream world, I just... assumed the worst.",Ribbit
npc4_9_2,,,"Please, you must tell me everything, what's happened?",Ribbit
npc4_9_3,,,Oh... oh gosh... Well that's... not great. I can't believe Drayto of all frogs is working for the RXRA... what do those slimy buggers want with Pond 7?,Ribbit
npc4_9_4,,,"There's a few places you could check, he used to use an old building to the south when he was working late nights, it's down past the climate research lab.",Ribbit
npc4_9_5,,,"There was also some old worksheds by the western dock, no one else really used them except for him though...",Ribbit
npc4_9_6,,,Either of those would be a good place to start I think.,Ribbit
npc4_10,"question 2, can I help? but finished",,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc4_10_1,,,"Oh, I think that's everything now actually! You've found all the caretaker keycards that I have marked as missing.",Ribbit
npc4_10_2,,,Now I can start prepping things here for when you bring everyone back from hibernation.,Ribbit
npc4_10_3,,,Thank you again for all of your help here!,Ribbit
npc4_11,"question 3, i found the seal",,I found the seal!,Ribbit
npc4_11_1,,,"Oh excellent, this was what the historian is after right?",Ribbit
npc4_11_2,,,I'm still not sure what these are used for... I've heard Dumeril mention them though but I can't quite recall the details.,Ribbit
npc4_11_3,,,I guess you'll be heading off for now to find the other ones? Be sure to pop by if you need anything else from me.,Ribbit
npc5_name,"posh, proper english, no contractions",,Dendro,Ribbit
npc5_tooltip,,,Oh hello Mudborne!,Ribbit
npc5_greeting1,"greeting, {{NAME}} is a merge field keep as written",,Greetings {{NAME}}!,Ribbit
npc5_greeting2,def. dialogue,,How can I be of assistance today?,Ribbit
npc5_action1,option 1,,,Ribbit
npc5_action2,option 2,,I have some questions,Ribbit
npc5_1_1,intro,,"Oh hello, {{NAME}} is it? I didn't realise she had sent a Mudborne!",Ribbit
npc5_1_2,,,"My name's Dendro, I was directing the rescue team here at Pond 7, but now that you are here you will be able to start getting everything back on track!",Ribbit
npc5_1_3,,,"Regrettably, when I came down here to meet with dear Hopert I must have triggered something - the stepping stones deactivated behind me as I hopped.",Ribbit
npc5_1_4,,,"I must apologise, it was very clumsy of me! I shall need your help to reactivate them.",Ribbit
npc5_1_5,,,"The reflection pool up there should lead to the correct mechanism, however it has an ancestry lock.",Ribbit
npc5_1_6,,,"I'm told ancestry locks do not just look at the frog's own genetic code, but look at previous generations' codes too!",Ribbit
npc5_1_7,,,"There is a lab near the workshop that was focused on ancestry research, the machines and notes inside should help you comprehend things.",Ribbit
npc5_1_8,,,"It is currently locked up tight, but as luck would have it I have a spare key right here!",Ribbit
npc5_1_9,,,Go and check through the lab and see what you can find out to help you open that pool.,Ribbit
npc5_2,question1,,What's your role in the team?,Ribbit
npc5_2_1,,,"My specialty is in language and history, I spend a lot of time investigating the ancient stone relics scattered about these old ponds.",Ribbit
npc5_2_2,,,"For instance, those stone pillars you have probably seen around, did you know they're much older than any of us? Even older than the Pondmothers in fact!",Ribbit
npc5_2_3,,,"Yet, if you decipher the frogham runes, they display genetic codes for frogs we only discovered rather recently.",Ribbit
npc5_2_4,,,"As a matter of fact, a lot of what you see around here was built by an ancient civilisation, sadly lost to... sorry look at me blithering away here!",Ribbit
npc5_2_5,,,My job here originally would have been to document the relics and writings and bring them back to the archives in Pond 3 so they're not lost entirely.,Ribbit
npc5_2_6,,,"However, now that you have arrived, I shall be assisting you with restoration as much as I can, and can guide you on the steps you need to take.",Ribbit
npc5_3,question2,,Can you tell me more about ancestry?,Ribbit
npc5_3_1,,,"Every frog has memories of its ancestry, passed down through the generations in their genetic code.",Ribbit
npc5_3_2,,,"If you take a common green and increase its size into a vast mudluker in one cycle, the resulting frog would recall this previous common green 'ancestor'.",Ribbit
npc5_3_3,,,"The reflection pools can read these ancestor memories, up to 6 ancestors past! We have only really just recently started to be able to understand how they work.",Ribbit
npc5_4,question3,,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc5_4_1,,,"Ah, you are very kind, but you have definitely got plenty to be getting on with for the time being!",Ribbit
npc5_4_2,,,"Once we get over to the central junction I will have even more tasks for you to be getting on with, so perhaps enjoy the silence while you can aha!",Ribbit
npc5_5,question4,,Eaten any nice bugs recently?,Ribbit
npc5_5_1,,,I have to admit I was practically living off the pink darners in the central region - they only come out at sunrise but they are one of the sweetest things I've eaten.,Ribbit
npc5_5_2,,,"I tried some of the local skaters here in the evening but they're definitely, how should I put it... an acquired taste! Not for me that's for certain!",Ribbit
npc5_6_1,intro2,,"Ah excellent work {{NAME}}, sorry I didn't wait for you, I was eager to get back up here!",Ribbit
npc5_6_2,,,"This is the Pondmother's Pool, a special place that connects her to both the waking and dreaming world, and in turn all the other pools you use.",Ribbit
npc5_6_3,,,"To open this pool, you'll first need to break the seal that's in place during hibernation. This will let you raise a path to access the doorway you can see across the water.",Ribbit
npc5_6_4,,,"There are three seals that you'll need to recover, one in Kindergarten, one in the Residential District, and one in Climate Control.",Ribbit
npc5_6_5,,,"Ribbert, our mycologist, is over in Kindergarten. They're trying to clear the algae that's overgrown the region.",Ribbit
npc5_6_6,,,"Kroaka, our engineer, is over in the Residential District. Apparently there's been a lot of flooding that needs to be sorted out first.",Ribbit
npc5_6_7,,,"I haven't gone to Climate Control myself, it's a bit too chilly for my tastes, but I'd say a good place to start would be the caretaker's building near the control core.",Ribbit
npc5_6_8,give quest,,"It doesn't really matter what seal you get first, I'd recommend meeting Ribbert in Kindergarten first though to ease you into things if it's all still a bit much!",Ribbit
npc5_7,question2 alt.,,What needs to be done again?,Ribbit
npc5_7_1,,,"Yes, apologies - there's a lot to cover!",Ribbit
npc5_7_2,,,"We need to get the Pondmother back into the waking world so she can respawn all of the survivors, but to do that you need to open her pool behind me.",Ribbit
npc5_7_3,,,However first you'll need to break the seal to raise the platform to grant you access it.,Ribbit
npc5_7_4,,,"There are 3 seals around the pond, 1 for each of the main regions - Kindergarten, Residential, and Climate Control.",Ribbit
npc5_7_5,,,Personally I think heading to Kindergarten and meeting Ribbert would be a good start if you want to ease into things gently.,Ribbit
npc5_7_6,,,I've put some notes down in your guidebook to help you.,Ribbit
npc5_8,question3 alt.,,Can I help you with anything?,Ribbit
npc5_8_1,,,"Ah you are very kind, but you definitely have your work cut out getting hold of those three seals!",Ribbit
npc5_8_2,,,"From what I gather it's a very old failsafe, so they're not exactly going to be in easy to reach places.",Ribbit
npc5_8_3,,,"Ribbert and Kroaka might have some ideas of where it might be in their respective regions, as they've been exploring the last few days.",Ribbit
npc5_8_4,,,"As for climate control you might have to check out the caretaker's building, see if anyone left any notes behind!",Ribbit
npc5_9,quest prompt,,I found all 3 seals!,Ribbit
npc5_9_1,,,Ah {{NAME}} - you continue to astound me!,Ribbit
npc5_9_2,,,"This is excellent work, and we're one step closer now to getting everything back to normal.",Ribbit
npc5_9_3,,,We should be able to use the system override to break the seal on the Pondmother's pool now.,Ribbit
npc5_9_4,,,I believe the machine should be somewhere near the Hibernation Center? It's not often needed so presumably it's a little bit out of the way.,Ribbit
npc5_9_5,,,Try having a look around there within the torporeal and see what you can determine.,Ribbit
npc5_10,quest prompt,,I can't get to the override...,Ribbit
npc5_10_1,,,"Oh dear, that is not good news. What seems to be the problem?",Ribbit
npc5_10_2,,,"How peculiar, I can't say I've heard about this black substance before. I'm loathe to admit it, but we're reaching the limits of my own knowledge on pool management.",Ribbit
npc5_10_3,,,There is one place where I imagine you can get the answers we need - the memory works.,Ribbit
npc5_10_4,,,It's a special research area set up by Dumeril to work on anything and everything related to the torporeal and our collective memories.,Ribbit
npc5_10_5,,,"I did manage to procure a key to the access tunnel, but it was still flooded when I last looked.",Ribbit
npc5_10_6,,,"However I do not imagine that will be a problem for you anymore now will it! Take the key and have a look around the area, perhaps you'll find some answers.",Ribbit
npc5_10_7,,,"There should be some central dream research building, which would make a good starting point. However the work there was top secret, so your guess is as good as mine!",Ribbit
npc5_11,,,"Oh Mudborne, there you are! You'd been gone a while, I was starting to get quite worried!",Ribbit
npc5_11_1,,,"Did you have any luck searching the Memory Works? Did you find any useful information, perhaps a survivor or two?",Ribbit
npc5_11_2,,,"No? Well, that is a awful shame, I would have expected there to be something at least.",Ribbit
npc5_11_3,,,"I'm not sure what to suggest now, perhaps we'll just have to accept that this pond is sadly lost...",Ribbit
npc5_12,,,"What... how on earth... oh! Mudborne! Excellent work! Yes, this is exactly what we wanted to achieve!",Ribbit
npc5_12_1,,,"You managed to use the seals to open the central platform, yes? Just as I knew they would.",Ribbit
npc5_12_2,,,"Regrettably it seems that the pool itself has its own genetic lock, and a 6 ancestor lock at that!",Ribbit
npc5_12_3,,,I've never seen something so complex in all my years... I fear this may be impossible even for your talents.,Ribbit
npc5_12_4,,,"Perhaps it's time to call it a day here, I think we've done all we can but sadly this pond seems to be lost...",Ribbit

npc7_1_5,,,"What?! The seals! No, no, no, that can't be right... who told you to do this?",Ribbit
npc7_1_6,,,The historian told you this? That's not... oh dear this is not good!,Ribbit
npc7_1_7,,,"Those seals are part of an old failsafe, designed to seal IN the Pondmother, not to save her!",Ribbit

npc7_2_7,,,"However the place is very old and fragmented from lack of use, so you'll need to restore the memory of it first.",Ribbit
npc7_2_8,,,Get yourself to the Defragmentation lab first and bring me back the research monograph there and I can show you how it works.,Ribbit
npc7_3,evidence part 1,,I found the personnel files!,Ribbit
npc7_3_1,,,"Ah well done, hopefully Dendro wasn't too suspicious of you skulking about?",Ribbit
npc7_3_2,,,Let me see here...,Ribbit
npc7_3_3,,,Ah. Ha. So that's certainly interesting - it seems you are haunted my friend. The records here say Dendro died back in 253.,Ribbit

note207_tooltip,,,A note on a sign by the docks.,Ribbit
note207_1,,,With the recent collapse of the kindergarten dockyard roof we'll be using this temporary pier to store harvests waiting to be sent over to cold storage. Please continue preparing shipments for collection as normal in this new location.,Ribbit

note208_4,,,My initial thoughts for this 'farmer' is to make a small enclosed environment that can replicate the natural one expected by the flora. Then we could plant smaller saplings of the plant and let it grow inside the farmer instead.,Ribbit
